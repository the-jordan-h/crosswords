# x_ops module "Crosstalk"

Crossword constructor tool for beginners

### Setup
Simply download and unzip the folder - then run the x_ops program, enter the file location of your (unscored) wordlist, and start mining it for themes!

1. Get the wordlist:
    * -(E.g. in crossword compiler, go to Words->Word List Manager->Convert->List to Plain Text File .. do not include word scores.)
1.  Double-click to run the x_ops.exe file from the folder you unzipped
1.  In the window that pops up, type in the file location of your list, e.g.:  C:\Downloads\mylist.txt
   * -(for MAC, to get the file path, right click on your txt file in Finder and hold the option key - then "Copy <yourfile> as Pathname")
1.  Use the functions to mine your list.  It's that easy!

  * `minus fetch` removes FETCH from the list; seriously stop trying to make fetch happen
* Write - write the entire wordlist in memory to a new file
  * `write my_new_list` writes your list to the file my_new_list.txt
  
### Notes
* You can limit the range of results - just type in a number or range of numbers separated by a dash to restrict the output: `5-16`
* Type 'help' to get a list of keywords and a short description
* Use `.` as for a wildcard "any letter"
* Regex expressions work on the endpoints.  So you could do something like `b [A,U][A,G]` for words that begin with the combinations of A or U as the first letter and A or G as the second letter.

### Disclaimers
* This module is not intended for entries with spaces.  You can do some stuff like `regex $STAR W.*` to get STAR WARS on such a list, but all functionality is not guaranteed
* This release is not optimized by, nor does it support, word scores
* Decoding is basic utf8, so nonstandard A-Z characters are **IGNORED**.  Ã‰CHAMELACULPA will render as only CHAMELACULPA in the list
